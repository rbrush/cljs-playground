# cljs-playground

Because sharing my meandering exploration of ClojureScript libraries seemed like a good idea.

This project can be launched by simply cloning the repository and invoking ```lein run``` from within the project:

```
git clone git@github.com:rbrush/cljs-playground.git
cd cljs-playground
lein run
```
